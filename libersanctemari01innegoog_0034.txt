Saron dialect was the universal spoken language of Lothian, Mense, and Tetiot-
dale, from the time oi David 1.

The court French afterwards imported by the English Edwards, and which
continued so long to be thelaw language oi England, never gained much ground
in Scotlnnd; and although doubtless used exclusirely by the English settlers ot'
that disturbed period 1, it seems not to have long survived their departure,
rhen Latin again became the universal language oi business, as it continued
to be down to the end ot' the ionrteenth century. About that period, the verna-
cular Saxon, the spoken language oi the lowlnnds οἰ Scotland, began to be used
in deeds‚ and instances of it occur in this collection, oi the reign oi Robert 11.
One ot‘ these ¹ is dated in 1389, and although much oi its interest is destroyed
by the closeness oi its translation from a Latin style, yet it is oi some value as a
genuine specimen oi early Scotah. .

The transactione serving to show the relative valae oi money and other com-
modities in Scotland, and the interest taken t'or money, at an early period, are
