cuncus particulam illustrating the tvroiold capacity of the Manias aa landovners
and aa rectore, while facts are incidentally mentioned which throvr light upon
the circumstances oi the seculae as well aa oi tha regular elergy. As land-
owners, the Monka vere always desimus oi evading the delivery oi tithes in lrind,
which seeum to have been peculiarly odiens to a body oi eccledastics capable oi
performing divine offices, and fortilied with various Papal immunities. In one
instance vre lind tbem yielding only to superior force *ς and in other parishes in
which they had large estates, they vere at length snoeeafnl in establishing under
the sanction ol the Bisbop, the King, and the Pope, a lixed composition, instead
ol a demand ior titbes varying according to the erup, the value oi dre currency‚
and perhaps the temper and disposition oi tbe Rector. When they were about
to demise to tenants the landa oi Kyle given to them by the Stevard, and thereby

'to give up their immunity from tbe payment ot titbe, they bad the landa created
into a distinct parish ol Macbline, ol which the Rectory vested in thessali-em

cautionaly providing, that it at any future time they should thinls fit to talse the
landa into their own hands, they should be freed from the burden of maintaining
tlte church and pensioning the vicar r.

The amount of tbe Vicar's pension saetam tc hare depended οο circumstances
which we eannm nou perhapsascertain ⁸. It appears tohave been paid unvil-
lingly, and in somecases vas, with tbe permission nithe Rector, entirely virhheld.
But if the Viears oi the richly endowed Regulam uere only scaritily and grndg.
ingly maintained by their wealthy patrem, it is evident that from tbe earliest
times the secular Rectors uere osten men ol vealtb and family. Someoi thern were
the younger sons of great houses ⁰, and we lind in more than one instance, elergy-
rnen possessed of considerable lauded property; and one instance occursbin the
early part of our recorda, of tbe Parson oia parish transmitting bis estate to his
daughter, probably of a legitimate'marriage l.

Witbout underrating the effecta oi the reformation oi religion, it may be aalely
said, that no revolution in politica or opinions can bave produced such a change
in the structure ol society as the emancipation oi the Clergy from celibacy, and
the sudden destruction ot the monastic societies. It is now dilicuit, perhaps
