may be en exception, where there seems to hove existed an extensive forest3 but
elsewhere, wood was o soaroe end valuoble commodity. Peste formed the com·

Even at Preeton, now so surrounded by conl mines, wood was used as fuel for
the salt pans. Coal is not mentioned in thia collection of the transactione ol'
Melsos till the reign of Robert 11. Γ. It was undoubtedly worked at an early
period in Sootland, hut probably only in the essiem levels and irr small quanti-
ties‚ from the imperfectior of machinery and engineering; arrd its use must have
been confined to a narrow circle from the difficulty oi carriage.

Border and in Ayrshire, were bounded on all sides by the territories of great
lords, jeelous ol all encroscbment on their rights of forest, end sometimes it
would seem, attempting to counteract the former munificence of themselves or
their sumtors, which had lavished on the favourite religioue house rights ol
geme ss well as all other property. Hence originated many of the disputes
and subsequent reconciliatione recorded in this collection. At first perhaps,
only the comsionel trespaseing ol the cattle and sheep of the Abbey interfered
with the pasture or the necessary quiet of the forest gsme; but in process of

time the monks, escaping from the strictness ol the Cistercian rule, asserted and
exercised in their· turn rights ol geme arrd forest, which they defended against

encroachment with all the machinery which the law then put in their power.
