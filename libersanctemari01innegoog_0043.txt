during eges of lawlessneee aad rapine3 recollecting too the peculim interest of
its peaceful and perhaps indoleat inhabitants in maintaining the quiet of the
country aad the security cf property, we mnnot doubt that their administraticn
of their great territory and ravenue, notwithstanding all abueee incident to the
system, nee more for the happiness of the people than if the pomeeeiom of the
Abbey hed fallen at en early period into the hande of some great temporat
proprietnr. But euch speculatione would extend beyond cur present limite. It
only remains to point out one or two particulare connected trith the public history
cf the country.

Eustace de Vesci confirma tc the Abbey all the lende in hie see cf Wittun,
which it held on the year aner Alexander Prinne of Scntland rendered homage
to King John of Englend, on the morrcw of the invention of the Holy crass
(eth May.) This homage was not known to our historiens It may be conjec-
tured to have taken place on the occasion of the Prinne receiving knightbcod at
the hande cf John in1212; but if thisbe the case, the date generally assigned
tc that esent must be emonscus ‘l

There ere few more interesting state pepere then the letter of Robert the
Bruce addreseed tobis son end his successore θ. Not contented with the procis
of his piety and regerd for Melrns which he had already given in the munificam
graats for the restoration of the building‚ ruined by continual ware, and for the
personal comfort of the Moches, the dying monarch bequeathe to his eon the cate
and protection cf that fascured house where he destined his heart to be buried.
It is remarkable that this document bears dates within a month of the King's
death. aad it follows that his request tc Douglas to convey hie beart to the Holy
Lend was made still nearer his end.

We look note with scarcely less interest to a notice which occure in this collec-

tion of the first erecticn of the city of Glasgcw. The charter of Bishop docelin ἃ, ’
