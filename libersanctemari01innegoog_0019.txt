These important charters, although they bave not escaped the notice of some of
our more diligent antiquaries ⁰, had fallen almost into oblivion, and only a tradi-
tion remaiued‚ that they ‘⁶ were preserved, until a recent period, in the archives
“ of the Earls of Mortondf When examined for the purpose of the present
publication, they were found to be contained in twenty-six linen begs, and
appeared not to have been disturbed since the middle of the last century. The
charters are generally in line preservation; and numemus seals are preserved,
many of which have, at carly periodo, been carefnlly protected by little begs of
linen still fitting closely round each seal.

These munimenta, before the dissolutior of the monastery, had already formed
the subject of two compilatione or chartularies The more ancient, as it

now existe, is very imperfect. It is preserved in the library of the Faculty of
Advocates at Edinburgh⁶, and consiste of 44 leaves of hellum, of a small
quarto siae, not always in proper order. It contains charters from the restoration
of the Abbey by King David 1.‚ down to the reign of Alexander 111, written
uniformly and at the same time, if not by one hand; and its execution msy be
safely ascribed to the end of the latter reign, or to the period ofeonfrrsicn which

immediately followed it. r . ‚

The other and more complete register of the title-deeds of Meiros is in the
British Museums. It is described as ‘⁴ a handsome folio of 119 leaves, well
“written on parchment, andin good preservatiou.” It· is of much later date,
and reoords occasional charters, even so low down as the reign of J ames 1v.

N either of these chartularies contains nearly the whole of the original olrarters
here printed, although they present some of which tlre originale are not now
preserved. But itis not in omitting charters only that they are wanting in the
interest of the originale. They scarcely ever give the witnesses, or the dates
where these occurat the end; and, of course, they always want the interesting
and often important authentication of the seal.
