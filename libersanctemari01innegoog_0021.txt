tude of instances, from the fallible conjectures of an editor, and places before
him the very fac-simile of the original writ.

It may be thought somewhat at varianae with this strict representation of the
original documenta, that the early deeds, which are printed at length in the pre-
vious part of the work, are not reprinted when they are recited in later charters ὅ.
The original deeds which still exist uudefaoed, whatever additional force in evi·
dence they might receive from subsequent confirmations, could not nequire
either fresh interest or more authenticity from these comparatively recent

transcripte.

Where, as iu most cases, contemporary, or at least very audent endorsements
were found on the charters, these have been adopted aa titles; and where either
chartulary was used, the title prefixed in it to each charter was adopted in
printing it. Where no title was found of any ancient authority, it baa been
thought proper to supply one; and this liberty, which is hut of rare occurrence,

can be detected by the supplied titles' being printed without abbreviatione.

of the seals remain still unengraved. There are very perfect impressione of most
of the Great Seals from the time of William the Lien, none of which have
been here engraved; partly because Anderson has already published them,
but chiefly because a complete series of our Royal ceals, engraved in a style
worthy of modern art, is a desideratum in Scotch History‚ and cannot be
supplied from one collection. For the latter reason, not without much hesitation,
the seals of the family of Douglas have been altogether omitted iu the platea,
though many beautiful specimens of them are to be found in this collection. A
tolerably complete serica of the seals of that family, which could be made up

some mistakes, iu the genealogy of that illustrious house.
