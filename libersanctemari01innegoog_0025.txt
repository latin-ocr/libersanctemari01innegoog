'l'hat a definite and fixed jurisprudence prevailed over the rest ot Seothndin
the reign of william, is in some degree established hy the frequent allusion to
the peculim customary lsws ol one province. The province ol Gallony, ol
much greater extent then the district now so called, comprehending s part
ol Dumfries-shhe and all the Earldom ol Carric, which annum much further
northward than the modern Bsiliary ol thst name ⁸, had but recently been
reduced tc an imperfect subjection tc the Crcvn of Sootlnnd, and πω still in a

stateoi comparative barbarism l. A series of chaners ascertains the genealogy
ol the great lords ol Gallovsy from son to father up to Fergns, never however
passing beyond that anoestor ⁸. From mese, and from the names ol places and
ol witnesses occurring in charters os other persons in that provinoe, it appears
that the body cl the pecple, most ol the proprietors ol the soil, and eren the
lords of the country, were ol Gaelic rsoe and lsnguage. The original popula-
tion must have been more strenuous or more successful in vindicating their rights
than the inhabitants ol the other districts ol' Scotland. The Norman settlers
seem tc have obtained a more insecure footing there than elsewhere, and alter
two or three generations they disappesr‚ ohne in the rude patronymic designa·
lions cl the native inhabitants may be traoed the original ol lnmilies that aiter-
nards rose tc power end distinction ³.

Of the peculiar lans ol Galloway we have here unfortunately only a reference
to certain arrangements lor facilitating the arrest ol criminals, rendered necemry
by the disturbed state of the province t. Nordoessny other source lumish us
with much information on this subject. We find in our socient statutes allusione
to the reservation of the Galwegiao customary laws3 hut nearly all we can gether
