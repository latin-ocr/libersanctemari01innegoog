ln prepnring and passing through the presa such a mass ol ancient documenta,
it is impossible but that many errors should have been committed. ln the ar-
rangement, especially with regard to the dates of the charters, alter every test
has been applied, there is often room ior differenoe ol opinion. It is sufficient
to say tbat none have been placed without much consideration. The grounds
on which dates have been assigned to the most doubtful have been preserved,
but it has not been thought proper to eneumher this work with those lucu-
brations of the compiler; neither has it been thought neoeoeary tu enumerate a
iew minute literal errore of the presa. Where an error occurs, by which the sense

is iujured or rendered doubtful, it has been corrected in the list oi moto.

The materiale thus brought together, forming as they do the lineat ool-
leotion ol ancient writs preserved in Seotland, comprising more than a hundred
royal charters from David 1. down to Robert the Bruoe, must be regarded
with interest by every intelligent student of Scotoh history. The render who
brings to their perusnl the temperate curiosity that seelts only for information re-
garding the history, lawe, and arts oi our foreiathers, may not sympathise with
the enthusiasm felt by the nealous antiquary ou the first excavation of such a
treaaure; hut there is much to repay the patient investigation oi the severer
student, while the more laborious triller in the curiosities of antiquity cannot fail
to find material of infinite speculation in these recorda of the administration of
monhish property from the days ol Saint David.

Upon the interesting subject of our ancient lawa and forms of legal procedure,
acollectiou of authentio write like the present, is calculated to throw more light
than the law compilatione ola laler date, which, although soon adopted by

Sootch lawyers, can only rank as transcripta or modificatione of the writiogs of

English jutists.
