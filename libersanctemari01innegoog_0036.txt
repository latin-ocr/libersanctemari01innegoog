romantio tradition of the mighty power which they wielded on the Borders
The proverbial instability ol Soctch affairs lor three centuries preceding the
uuion cl the Crowns, was generally anlavourable tc the continued descent of
hereditary pcssesalons; but on the Borders, wars, ieuds and forfeitures followed
each other so laet, tlvct no lumilies proved sufficiently vigorous to take mot and
grow to grandour.

The alliances, desoents and transactions of many oi those exticot families, and
still mors those ol the illustricus house oi Stewurt are however essential to the
history ol a country where they played so important a part; aud some ol the
existing iamilies cf Scotlnnd can still boast a connexion with even the most an-
cient oi those illustrioris and historical names i·

The numerous seals preserved in this collection are not only interesting to the
herald, but often furnish important information ol tbe ovuer’a real style aud title,
when the cherter happens to set forth only his icmiliar or patronymic appella-
tion ¹, and enable ustodistinguish between several persons oi the mme patronymic
name ⁸. lt is scarcely necessary to notice that they at the same thne serve to
mark the state of the arts ot tbe country, and are in Scotlaud almost our only
guides in tracing the arms and dress ol a remote period.

The use cf seals is almost ooeval in this country with the use oi vriting.
Only two or three genuine ancient writs are known, which exbibit a differem
mode ol authentication ⁸, and we have little reason to believe, tbat there were
